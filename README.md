Fray – The Prompt Studio 🧠🎛️

“Where prompts become programs.”

Fray is a local-first, block-based visual prompt editor inspired by Scratch and built for prompt engineers, developers, designers, and educators. It helps you compose, structure, and refine prompts with precision and clarity—no more tangled walls of text or trial-and-error guessing.

Built in V0 and expanding rapidly, Fray blends creativity with engineering discipline by offering a playground for modular prompt construction, live output previewing, and interactive prompt education.

🧑‍🎓 The Mission

Fray is built with an MIT philosophy at its core:
	•	Open access to learning tools for the next generation of AI engineers.
	•	Transparency in prompt engineering workflows.
	•	Empowerment through education and ethical design.

We believe everyone should have the tools to understand and shape AI—not just consume it.
